        In the drench mixtures there were a very limited effect on propiconazole, imazalil and pyrimethanil over a 24-hour exposure

        @ Biodegradation for DDAC - Several bacterial species, as occurring in sludge, can degrade DDAC effectively.  Certain Pseudomonas spp. freely occurring in the
        environment, are also able to degrade DDAC.
        # When peracetic acid is diluted to less than 100 ppm, (~0,07 % Hypercide) it is rabidly biodegradable in sludge/sewage systems.

        •  DO NOT contaminate streams, rivers or waterways with the chemicals or used containers.
        •  Dispose of spent dip in an authorised dip disposal facility.
        •  If no authorised dip disposal facility is available, dispose dip in a responsible and environmentally acceptable manner and always
          adhere to the local authority’s disposal guidelines.
        •  Surplus mix shall be disposed of in a manner that does compromise neither food safety nor the environment.

        extracts from international guideline (ePA information Bulletin – interim Guidelines for the disposal of waste fungicide
        produced by apple and pear growers. Publication 645)
        •  Spray used mixture over flat land, dedicated for this purpose.  Do not exceed the standard spent dip rate of 20 000 ℓ/ha or 600 kg
          of active per hectare. It is advantageous to contain the excess spent dip wash within a pasture area, from which stock and people
          can be excluded, on a flat or slightly sloping terrain, with a bunted border of at least 15 cm high, prepared for this purpose.
        •  The bund is used to contain the dip within an identifiable area where it will soak in and where sunlight and soil bacteria will
          degrade the chemicals.  Make sure that there is no run-off into water ways.  It is unacceptable to allow spent dip wash to enter
          dams, ponds or any watercourse.
        •  Waste fungicide dip should not be sprayed on areas where groundwater is less than 1.5 metres from the surface or below the
          100-year flood line.
        •  Do not spray the used mixtures on crops.
        •  Dust control: Do not exceed the standard spent dip rate of 20 000 ℓ/ha, or 600 kg of active per hectare.  Waste fungicide dip
          should not be sprayed on farm roads when rain is expected within 24 hours and where such areas may be subject to heavy
          traffic within 24 hours, or until the road is dry.
